# H&M Real-Time Personalized Recommender

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **real-time personalized recommender system** for **H&M Group** using machine learning. The goal is to enhance user experience by suggesting relevant fashion items based on customer behavior and preferences. This system is designed to scale efficiently and provide fast, accurate recommendations.

## Problem Statement
H&M Group aims to improve customer engagement and increase sales through personalized recommendations. The challenge is to process vast amounts of customer interactions, transaction history, and product details to make **real-time recommendations** that feel intuitive and personalized.

## Dataset
The dataset, provided by H&M Group, contains:
- **Customer data**: User demographics, purchase history, and engagement details.
- **Article data**: Product metadata, descriptions, and categories.
- **Transaction history**: Past purchases and interactions.

## Approach
The solution is built using **collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning models**. The workflow includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and transforming raw data.
   - Handling missing values and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding purchase patterns and customer behavior.
3. **Model Development**
   - Matrix Factorization (ALS, SVD, NMF)
   - Deep Learning models (Neural Collaborative Filtering, Transformer-based models)
   - Hybrid models combining content and collaborative approaches
4. **Real-Time Inference**
   - Optimized model deployment for low-latency recommendations
   - API development using **FastAPI/Flask**
5. **Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Precision, Recall, and NDCG metrics for recommendation quality
   - Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Recommendation Libraries** (Surprise, Implicit, LightFM)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **FastAPI/Flask** (for model deployment)
- **AWS/GCP** (for cloud-based scaling)

## Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in personalized recommendations.
- Improved engagement by **analyzing customer interaction patterns**.
- Deployed an optimized, **scalable API** for real-time recommendations.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for better representation learning.
- Improve real-time inference using **Faiss for fast similarity search**.
- Extend to **multi-modal recommendations** by integrating text & image features.
